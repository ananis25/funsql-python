`funsql` is a python library to write SQL queries in a way that is more composable. 

The initial implementation is mostly a line by line port of the Julia library [FunSQL.jl](https://github.com/MechanicalRabbit/FunSQL.jl/). Thanks to the original authors who have been refining the idea for some time! While I try improve the documentation here, go over to the parent repository which motivates the project. 

The `docs` directory has examples on how to use the library.
* `using-nodes.ipynb` - shows how to use FunSQL to construct SQL queries. This is the user facing API. 

The repository [funsql-examples](https://github.com/ananis25/funsql-examples) contains more examples of queries written using FunSQL.
